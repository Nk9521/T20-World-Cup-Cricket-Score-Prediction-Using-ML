Description of the project :- 
                                  This project aims to predict T20 World Cup cricket scores using a machine learning model built with NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, and advanced tools like XGBoost and SteamLib. The workflow includes data cleaning and preprocessing with NumPy and pandas, followed by visualization to understand data patterns and insights. The data is concatenated and prepared for modeling. For the prediction model, XGBoost is employed to leverage its powerful boosting capabilities, while SteamLib is used to enhance the application interface. The project provides a comprehensive approach to data handling, model training, and deployment, offering a practical solution for accurate cricket score forecasting.
